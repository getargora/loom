**Argora Loom** is a powerful yet lightweight platform for managing domains, DNS zones, servers, resellers, and billing — all in one unified interface. It includes a built-in order and invoice system, allowing users to request services like domain registrations or server plans, which are then processed and provisioned via EPP or other APIs.

While easy to use and modular by design, Argora Loom is also in active development to support the full feature set required by **ICANN-accredited registrars**, including escrow, RDAP, contact validation, and reporting tools.

It’s ideal for self-hosted registrars, resellers, and service providers who want flexibility, control, and a clean starting point without the bloat.

## Acknowledgements

**Argora Loom** is built on top of the **Argora Foundry** framework — a modular, extensible boilerplate designed for modern SaaS platforms, control panels, and admin tools.

**Argora Foundry**, in turn, is based on the excellent [hezecom/slim-starter](https://github.com/omotsuebe/slim-starter) by [Hezekiah Omotsuebe](https://github.com/omotsuebe), which provided a solid and clean foundation using **Slim Framework 4**.
